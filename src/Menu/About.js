            The ADIP Scheme is in operation since 1981 with the main objective
            to assist the needy disabled persons in procuring durable,
            sophisticated and scientifically manufactured, modern, standard aids
            and appliances that can promote their physical, social and
            psychological rehabilitation by reducing the effects of disabilities
            and enhance their economic potential. Assistive devices are given to
            PwDs with an aim to improve their independent functioning and to
            arrest the extent of disability and occurrence of secondary
            disability. The aids and appliances supplied under the Scheme must
            have due certification. The scheme also envisages conduct of
            corrective surgeries, wherever required, before providing an
            assistive device. Under the Scheme, grants-in-aid are released to
            various implementing agencies (Artificial Limbs Manufacturing
            Corporation of India (ALIMCO)/National Institutes/Composite Regional
            Centres/District Disability Rehabilitation Centres/ State
            Handicapped Development Corporations/ NGOs, etc.) for purchase and
            distribution of aids and assistive devices. The Scheme was last
            revised w.e.f. 1.4.2014 and further modified and approved for
            continuation during the remaining period of the 14th Finance
            Commission i.e., up to 31.3.2020.
